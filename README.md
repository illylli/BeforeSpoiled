#BeforeSpoiled

This is an interesting project which reminds people about all the food they had in their fridge.

Have you ever met the situation that some food you just bought them once and never thought about them twice after they had been put in the fridge?

Have you ever forgot to bring your shopping list with you after you drove to the grocery store?

This is simple but beautiful app will help you to remind you by sending notifications about how many days left before it is too late to eat your bananas, drink your milk, and cook your salmons. Also before you put all the things in your fridge, we assume you must have been to the supermarket. Don't worry, we also help you remember the list. You can create one by typing it in your fingers, or you can use the voice input!

This app is very small but helpful. We are currently make it better.
